# Contributing to n8n Workflows

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the n8n Workflows collection! This guide will help you contribute effectively.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Adding New Workflows

#### Business Automation Workflows
Place workflows in `workflows/business-automation/{category}/`:
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `customer-onboarding-automation.json`)
- Include comprehensive metadata
- Test workflows before submission

#### Platform-Specific Workflows  
Place workflows in `workflows/platform-specific/{platform}/`:
- Focus on specific platform integrations
- Include setup instructions in metadata
- Document required credentials

#### Community Workflows
Place general workflows in `workflows/community-collection/{category}/`:
- Use meaningful categorization
- Include complexity assessment
- Add integration information

### 2. Workflow Format

Each workflow should include enhanced metadata:
```json
{
  "id": "unique-workflow-id",
  "name": "Descriptive Workflow Name",
  "nodes": [ /* n8n nodes */ ],
  "connections": { /* n8n connections */ },
  "_metadata": {
    "id": "unique-workflow-id",
    "name": "Descriptive Workflow Name",
    "description": "Detailed description of what this workflow does",
    "source": "business-automation|platform-specific|community-collection",
    "category": {
      "business": "ai-ml|finance|healthcare|etc",
      "platform": "gmail|slack|discord|etc",
      "type": "automation|integration|analysis"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "complexity": "beginner|intermediate|advanced",
      "department": "IT|Marketing|Sales|HR|etc",
      "nodes_count": 12,
      "integrations": ["gmail", "openai", "slack"],
      "estimated_cost": "low|medium|high",
      "security_level": "public|internal|confidential"
    },
    "tags": ["email", "ai", "automation"],
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 3. Quality Standards

#### Workflow Requirements
- âœ… Must be valid JSON
- âœ… Must include all required metadata
- âœ… Must have descriptive name and description
- âœ… Must specify correct complexity level
- âœ… Must list all integrations used
- âœ… Must be tested and functional

#### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens
- Include primary function and platform if applicable
- Examples:
  - `gmail-ai-email-labeling.json`
  - `slack-daily-standup-reminder.json`
  - `openai-content-generator.json`

### 4. Testing Your Contribution

Before submitting, run the validation scripts:

```bash
# Validate workflow format
python scripts/validate_workflow.py path/to/your/workflow.json

# Update database
python scripts/update_database.py

# Test documentation system
python run.py
```

### 5. Submission Process

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b add-new-workflow`
3. **Add your workflow** to the appropriate directory
4. **Run validation**: `python scripts/validate.py`
5. **Commit your changes**: `git commit -m "Add email automation workflow"`
6. **Push to your fork**: `git push origin add-new-workflow`
7. **Create a Pull Request**

### 6. Pull Request Guidelines
